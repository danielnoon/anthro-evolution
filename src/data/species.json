    "description": "The Bengal slow loris is a strepsirrhine primate and a species of slow loris native to the Indian subcontinent and Indochina. It is the largest species of slow loris, measuring 10 to 15 in from head to tail and weighing between 2.2 and 4.6 lb. Like other slow lorises, it has a wet nose, a round head, flat face, large eyes, small ears, a vestigial tail, and dense, woolly fur. The toxin it secretes from its brachial gland differs chemically from that of other slow loris species and may be used to communicate information about sex, age, health, and social status.\nThe Bengal slow loris is nocturnal and arboreal, occurring in both evergreen and deciduous forests. It prefers rainforests with dense canopies, and its presence in its native habitat indicates a healthy ecosystem. It is a seed disperser and pollinator, as well as a prey item for carnivores. Its diet primarily consists of fruit, but also includes insects, tree gum, snails, and small vertebrates. In winter, it relies on plant exudates, such as sap and tree gum. The species lives in small family groups, marks its territory with urine, and sleeps during the day by curling up in dense vegetation or in tree holes. It is a seasonal breeder, reproducing once every 12â€“18 months and usually giving birth to a single offspring. For the first three months, mothers carry their offspring, which reach sexual maturity at around 20 months. The Bengal slow loris can live up to 20 years.",

    "status": "endangered",
    "description": "The aye-aye is a long-fingered lemur, Madagascan primate with rodent-like teeth that perpetually grow, and a special thin middle finger used for percussive foraging. It is the world's largest nocturnal primate and is characterized by its unusual method of finding food: it taps on trees to find grubs, then gnaws holes in the wood using its forward-slanting incisors to create a small hole into which it inserts its narrow middle finger to pull the grubs out.\nYoung aye-ayes typically are silver colored on their front and have a stripe down their back. However, as the aye-ayes begin to reach maturity, their bodies will be completely covered in thick fur and are typically not one solid color. On the head and back, the ends of the hair are typically tipped with white while the rest of the body will ordinarily be a yellow and/or brown color.\nAmong the aye-aye's signature traits are its fingers. The third finger, which is much thinner than the others, is used for tapping, while the fourth finger, the longest, is used for pulling grubs and insects out of trees, using the hooked nail. The skinny middle finger is unique in the animal kingdom in that it possesses a ball-and-socket metacarpophalangeal joint. The aye-aye has also evolved a sixth digit, a pseudothumb, to aid in gripping.\nThe complex geometry of ridges on the inner surface of aye-aye ears helps to sharply focus not only echolocation signals from the tapping of its finger, but also to passively listen for any other sound produced by the prey. These ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a Fresnel lens, and may be seen in a large variety of unrelated animals, such as lesser galago, bat-eared fox, mouse lemur, and others.",

    "description": "The gray slender loris is a species of primate in the family Lorisidae. It is native to India and Sri Lanka and inhabits subtropical and tropical dry forests and subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.\n\nSlender lorises are recognised for having extremely gracile limbs and extreme stereoscopic vision. The gray slender loris has a wide variation in pelage colour and each subspecies can be identified by this. The fur is short and gray or reddish on their backs, sometimes a darker stripe extends from the top of their head to the end of their back. The ventrum is white or buff-coloured. The eyes are surrounded with darker fur and have orbits which look straight forward giving excellent stereoscopic vision and are located the closest together amongst the primates. Between the eyes there is a white patch of hair known as the median stripe. The muzzle is larger and less pointed than the red slender loris. The hands are also highly specialised with a reduced second digit that allows the loris to cling to small branches. This is further augmented by adaptions in the first metatarsal that are thought to allow an extremely firm grasp. The tail is vestigial.",

    "description": "The ring-tailed lemur is highly social, living in groups of up to 30 individuals, and is female dominant. To keep warm and reaffirm social bonds, groups will often huddle together. The ring-tailed lemur will also sunbathe, sitting upright facing its underside, with its thinner white fur towards the sun. Like other lemurs, this species relies strongly on its sense of smell and marks its territory with scent glands. The males perform a unique scent marking behavior called spur marking and will participate in stink fights by marking their tail with their scent and wafting it at opponents. It is omnivorous and the most terrestrial of extant lemurs. The animal is diurnal, being active exclusively in daylight hours.\nAs one of the most vocal primates, the ring-tailed lemur uses numerous vocalizations including group cohesion and alarm calls. Experiments have shown that the ring-tailed lemur, despite the lack of a large brain, can organize sequences, understand basic arithmetic operations and preferentially select tools based on functional qualities.",

This lemur is endemic to eastern Madagascan rainforests and is distinguished by patches of white skin below the eyes, giving rise to a \"teardrop\" effect, particularly conspicuous in the male. The species exhibits diurnal behavior and marked sexual dimorphism.\nBeing sexually dimorphic, the males the species exhibit a medium-long, dense dorsal coat of intense chestnut brown. Ventrally, they are lighter and redder in hue, while their tail, muzzle and head are black. For females, the dorsal area and tail resemble males, whereas the ventral fur is a contrasting white-cream color. Facial markings are similar to males, except that \"tear drops\" are less exaggerated and spiry thick cheek hairs of males are absent. Whereas the genus Eulemur relatives may exhibit ear tufts or a furry beard, these features are absent for E. rubriventer, which has thickened fur around its ears, lending a fuller facial appearance.",
